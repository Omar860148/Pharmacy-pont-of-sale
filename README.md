# Pharmacy-pont-of-sale
This is a Pharmacy/Medical Store Point of Sale (POS) System. This was developed by Omar Mohamed using PHP and MySQL Database. The system manages the Pharmacy's Sales transaction with their customers and also manages their medicinal products stocks. The system stores the products along with some details such as the supplier and the product categories. The product categories are dynamically stored in the database which means the category options have a front-end managing feature to allow the system admin manage the list of options. The system also counts the product availability in each category and also generates a printable sales report.  This Medical Store POS System was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap for the design
